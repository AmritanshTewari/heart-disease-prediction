# Heart Disease Prediction System

This project is a **Heart Disease Prediction System** aimed at predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical attributes using **machine learning** techniques. The system takes input data from medical records, applies data processing, and then uses a machine learning model to predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict heart disease.
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the models.
- **User Input**: Allows input of patient medical data to predict the risk of heart disease.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes key patterns and trends in the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains patient information such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol level
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting electrocardiographic results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- Oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise)
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- Thalassemia

The dataset used is included in the repository (`data.csv`).

## Installation
